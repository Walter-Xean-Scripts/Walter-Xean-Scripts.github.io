## Our core library
Our core is a collection of scripts that we use across our resources.
It's got stuff for blips, callbacks, markers, game pools, synchronized scenes, streaming, vehicles and then "Foact" - our own UI library made for making UIs entirely in LUA.

Feel free to use this resource in your scripts (Even in stuff you sell - only thing we ask is that you link to our store for downloading it), it can be downloaded for free from our store. It's important to note that this resource **is** obfuscated, so you won't be able to make changes yourself.

Want something complicated simplified with our core for your scripts? Reach out on Discord, and we might be able to do just that!
