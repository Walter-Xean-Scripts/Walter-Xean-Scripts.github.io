Setting up the core is quite simple.

### Steps
1. Download the latest release over at [GitHub](https://github.com/Walter-Xean-Scripts/wxs_core/releases)
2. Extract the folder located inside into your desired location
3. Make sure to change the name from `wxs_core-<version>` to `wxs_core`
4. Ensure the resource in your `server.cfg`, example: `ensure wxs_core`
5. Start the server and you're good to go!
