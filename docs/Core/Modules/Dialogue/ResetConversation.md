This is quite straight forward, it clears the current conversation. This is useful if you want to start a new conversation with a different ped, or if you want to start a new conversation with the same ped.

### Function
```lua
local Dialogue = WXSCore.Dialogue
Dialogue:ResetConversation()
```

### Example
```lua
local Dialogue = WXSCore.Dialogue
Dialogue:ResetConversation()
```
